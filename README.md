Technical Notes and Considerations
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile, build, and execute the Section 04 files and directories,

	(1) click on the blud "Code" button above and click the
	    "Download Zip" link, or
	(2) copy the code and paste it directly into your preferred
	    Integrated Development Environment (IDE), CLion, CodeLite
	    or Code::Blocks, for example, or your preferred text editor,
	    Vim, Nano, or Emacs, for example, and either   
	(3) compile, build, and execute the files in your IDE, or
	(4) use the following command-line script in C++:

		$ g++ name_of_file.c -o main
		$ ./main

	(5) use the following command-line script in C:

		$ gcc name_of_file.cpp -o main
		$ ./main

	(6) use the following command-line script in Python:
