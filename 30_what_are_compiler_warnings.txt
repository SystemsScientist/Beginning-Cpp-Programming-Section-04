Section 04: What Are Compiler Warnings
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compiler Warnings

	- Do NOT ignore them!

	- the compiler has recognized an issue with your code
	  that oculd lead to a potential problem

	- it's only a warning because the compiler is still able
	  to generate correct machine code

	  	int miles_driven;

		std::cout << miles_driven;

	- warning: 'miles_driven' is uninitialized
